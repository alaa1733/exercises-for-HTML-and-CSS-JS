        The 10 Best Indoor Hanging Plants to Turn Your Home Into a Jungle
    </h2>
    
    <p> <strong >Interior design </strong> <del> not be everyone’s strong suit</del>, but even the newest decorator can use a simple trick to <em>an atmosphere:</em> <br/>
        <ins>indoor plants</ins>. Unlike choosing artwork or accent furniture, plants have an effortless way of creating dimension, style, and permanence <br/>
        in a home and many species even clean the air. If you're enchanted by the look of trailing, vine-like greenery bringing the outdoors <br/>
        into your space, let us suggest hanging your plants to give them plenty of room to grow long and lush.How exactly should you go about it? <br/> 
        We asked Christoper Satch, <em>plant scientist</em> at the online greenery store,The Sill <strong>"Depending on where you're hanging up your plant</strong>, you'll want
        to pick one that will thrive in the light that spot receives—whether it's bright, medium, or low light," Satch says. "Choose your plant accordingly.
        <sup>1</sup>Whether you're a pet owner,an over-waterer, or you're looking for the best low maintenance plants, there's a species to flourish in each area of your home.
       <sub>Once you’ve selected one,</sub> Satch recommends keeping your level of access in mind. "If you're able to hop on a stool and reach the pot easily,you might not mind 
       choosing a plant that requires a weekly watering," he says. "If it's a hassle to reach, you might want to opt for a plant with succulent qualities,which might only need to be watered about once a month.

        <b>So, here are the top 5 indoor plants that will help one spruce up the interiors:</b><br>
      <b><ins>Maranta Plant: </ins></b>
      Native to tropical Central & South America and the West Indies, Maranta is a type of flowering <br>
      plants in the family of Marantaceae. This plant is named in the honour of an Italian physician & botanist<br>
       of 16th Century named Bartolomeo Maranta. This is an evergreen plant and would add just the right amount <br>
       of drama to a home. The notable feature of this plant is that in the daytime the leaves are flat but in the <br>
       evening, the leaves fold up and resemble a folded hand during prayers. For this reason, it is also called a <br>
       prayer plant. Another interesting fact about this plant is that the closure of the leaves is the plants way to<br>
        conserve moisture. It is an ideal plant for humid kitchens too apart from sprucing up the drawing-room.<br><br>
        <b><ins>Rubber Plant:</ins></b>
       The shining large leaves are one of the finest additions to those large rooms. <br>
       They can grow up to 10 feet – adding spectacular energy to one’s space. One can use<br>
        white pots to place the rubber plants and keep them in the corner to jazz up the interiors <br>
        beautifully. If someone has a small room, then also, it is advised to paint it white and keep a<br>
         rubber plant at the corner in a white pot – this trick will make the small space look larger. Rubber<br>
          plants are also approved by NASA as a great plant to improve the indoor air quality. Their large leaves <br>
          can absorb airborne chemicals and break them down, making them harmless. They also remove bacteria and <br>
          mold spores in the air.The large leaves help in cleaning the air in a better way. The contaminants drawn by <br>
          the plant are deposited in the soil which meets the microbes there. The microbes then break down the <br>
          contaminants and convert them into essential nutrients for the plant.
