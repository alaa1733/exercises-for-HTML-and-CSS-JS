        The 10 Best Indoor Hanging Plants to Turn Your Home Into a Jungle
    </h3>
    
    <p> <strong >Interior design </strong> <del> not be everyone’s strong suit</del>, but even the newest decorator can use a simple trick to <em>an atmosphere:</em> <br/>
        <ins>indoor plants</ins>. Unlike choosing artwork or accent furniture, plants have an effortless way of creating dimension, style, and permanence <br/>
        in a home and many species even clean the air. If you're enchanted by the look of trailing, vine-like greenery bringing the outdoors <br/>
        into your space, let us suggest hanging your plants to give them plenty of room to grow long and lush.How exactly should you go about it? <br/> 
        We asked Christoper Satch, <em>plant scientist</em> at the online greenery store,The Sill <strong>"Depending on where you're hanging up your plant</strong>, you'll want<br/> 
        to pick one that will thrive in the light that spot receives—whether it's bright, medium, or low light," Satch says. "Choose your plant accordingly.<br/>
        <sup>1</sup>Whether you're a pet owner,an over-waterer, or you're looking for the best low maintenance plants, there's a species to flourish in each area of your home.<br/>
       <sub>Once you’ve selected one,</sub> Satch recommends keeping your level of access in mind. "If you're able to hop on a stool and reach the pot easily,you might not mind <br/>
       choosing a plant that requires a weekly watering," he says. "If it's a hassle to reach, you might want to opt for a plant with succulent qualities,<br/>which might only need to be watered about once a month.
